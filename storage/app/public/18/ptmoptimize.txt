Hello! Please optimize the following Blade template section according to our established process.

**Page:** [e.g., Homepage, About Us Page, Tour Details Page]
**Section:** [e.g., Main Content, Image Gallery, Testimonials]

---

### **Primary Goal**
Please optimize the following code for **SEO** and **Page Load Speed**.

### **Key Rules & Constraints**
1.  **No Front-End Changes:** Do not change the HTML structure, CSS classes, or visual layout. All optimizations must work within the existing theme.
2.  **Preserve Custom Logic:** If you see complex PHP or Blade logic, especially for image paths, please preserve it. It is there for a specific reason related to my setup.
3.  **Code Cleanup:** Please remove all Blade and HTML comments.
4.  **Final Output:** Provide the complete, fully optimized code block for the section as the final answer.

### **Context (Optional, but very helpful):**
* **Location on Page:** Is this section "above the fold" (visible on load) or "below the fold" (requires scrolling)?
* **Important Notes:** Are there any specific links, scripts, or elements that have a special function I should be aware of?
