I want you to help me **improve the SEO** of my web page. I’ll paste the full HTML (or Blade/Laravel) code of my homepage below. Please review and:

1. **Fix or improve the page title** to reflect the content and use target keywords like "Morocco tours", "excursions", "car rentals", "activities", etc.
2. **Update the H1 heading** so it's relevant to the page content and avoid duplication.
3. **Check for and remove duplicate heading tags** (like H4/H5/H6 with the same text multiple times).
4. **Optimize the internal link structure**: Avoid duplicate links and improve anchor text (replace “Read more” or “Click here” with meaningful text).
5. **Add a canonical tag** to avoid duplicate content issues.
6. **Fix the `lang` attribute in the `<html>` tag** (should be `fr` or `en` depending on the page).
7. **Add `hreflang` tags** if the site supports multiple languages (e.g., French and English).
8. **Ensure proper use of alt text for images**, and recommend improvements if needed.
9. **Enable or suggest code for 301 redirect** between www and non-www versions of the site.
10. **Add a valid robots.txt and sitemap.xml reference**.
11. **Ensure UTF-8 charset and HTML5 doctype are present and correct**.
12. **Add social sharing meta tags** (Open Graph and Twitter Card).
13. **Suggest performance improvements** like compressing images, enabling GZIP, or improving response time.
